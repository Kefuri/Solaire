# Solaire #

## Welcome to Solaire, the turn-based battle game! ##

### What is Solaire? ###

As part of my Computer Science A-Level, I was asked to create a final programming project, to show proficiency in the design principles covered on the course.
As an all-time lover of Pok√©mon, this felt like the perfect chance to create my own version, just as I had imagined doing as a small child. And as such, Solaire was born.

### What Tech Stack? ##

Solaire is built primarily in Python, using the TKinter library for a GUI. It has a MySQL database attached, which the backend communicates to using the sqlite3 module.
